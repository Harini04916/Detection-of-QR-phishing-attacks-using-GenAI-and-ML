The dataset consists of two categories — benign QR codes and malicious QR codes — both used for training and testing. Each image was resized to a fixed dimension, normalized, and labeled (0 for benign and 1 for malicious). This ensured that all data was clean, balanced, and ready for model training.First, several traditional machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and MLP were applied, achieving accuracies between 60% and 80%. To improve accuracy, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was then developed. The CNN automatically extracted visual features using convolution, pooling, and dense layers, achieving 85–90% accuracy — much higher than the traditional models. Additionally, transfer learning with the EfficientNetB3 model was explored to further enhance performance, expected to reach above 90% accuracy.The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, with CNN proving to be the most reliable and effective approach. In conclusion, the project demonstrates that deep learning (CNN) can successfully classify QR codes as benign or malicious. This method can be implemented in QR code scanner applications to warn users about unsafe codes, thereby improving cybersecurity and user protection. The project was implemented in Python using TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib in Google Colab, with the dataset sourced from Kaggle.
